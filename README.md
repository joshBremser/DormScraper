# DormScraper
This was a project for an ethics class where I had exploited a vulnerabilty in the school system
I was able to retrieve all of the dorms and their occupants

this project was private before the vulnerability was fixed, but now that I worked with a contact in
the UMaine system it's since been fixed, so I might aswell put this as public

I actually have more code locally thats needed for this to work that I was too lazy to commit,
but I don't really care cause it wouldn't work anyways
